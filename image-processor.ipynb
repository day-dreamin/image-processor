    "# AI-Powered Image Processing Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbot that integrates Google Generative AI with powerful image processing tools like ImageMagick and exiftool. The main goal is to automate image-related tasks in a way that’s efficient and user-friendly, making it accessible for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Advanced AI model:\n",
    "   Uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash model from Google, which helps the chatbot understand user queries in natural language. This makes it easy for anyone to interact with the system without needing to know any technical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Command Execution:  \n",
    "   The chatbot can execute specific commands like `convert`, `exiftool`, and `ls`. This allows users to perform tasks such as converting images, extracting metadata, or listing files—all through simple text commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. User-Friendly Interaction:  \n",
    "   Aimed to make the chatbot friendly and helpful. It generates concise responses that focus directly on the user’s requests, minimizing unnecessary information and keeping the conversation flowing smoothly.\n"
